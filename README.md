# Workflow:

### 1. Asking right question
  - Reason to select project
  - Strengths and Weaknesses
  - Meaning
### 2. Preparing data
  - Find the data
  - Import and clean data
  - Explore data 
  - Generate model data to Tidy data
  
### 3. Selecting Algorithms
  - Learning Algorithms
  - Determined the Algorithms
  - Appling for project
  
### 4. Training model
  - Image processing
  - Apply CNN algorithm and save model
  - Try all the case with learning rate and scale of training/testing image
### 5. Testing
  - Testing all model and evaluate
  - Select the best model
  - Report
